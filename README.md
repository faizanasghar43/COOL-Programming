Welcome to the COOL Programming Repository! This initiative is driven by the limited resources available on the COOL (Classroom Object-Oriented Language) domain. Designed to bridge this gap, this repository contains well-documented code snippets, examples, and tutorials, primarily curated for enthusiasts, learners, and students of Stanford's Compiler course. Dive in, and let's make learning COOL truly cool!

Why This Repository?

Filling the Void: There's a noticeable lack of extensive resources on COOL programming. This repository seeks to change that.
Stanford's Compiler Course: This effort is specifically tailored to assist learners of Stanford's esteemed Compiler course, ensuring they have a smooth journey through COOL programming.
Community Collaboration: Contributions are welcomed! Whether you're a student, educator, or a COOL enthusiast, let's grow and refine this resource together.
Thank you for being a part of this journey. Happy coding!
